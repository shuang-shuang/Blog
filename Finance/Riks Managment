Value at Risk (VAR) calculates the maximum loss expected (or worst case scenario) on an investment, over a given time period
      and given a specified degree of confidence.
Three ways to calculate:
1. The historical method simply re-organizes actual historical returns, putting them in order from worst to best. It then
   assumes that history will repeat itself, from a risk perspective.
2. The Variance-Covariance Method assumes that stock returns are normally distributed. Plot the normal distribution curve with
   historical data
3. Monte Carlo Simulation: This  method involves developing a model for future stock price returns and running multiple 
   hypothetical trials through the model.
