Buy Side vs Sell Side:
Buy-side firms focus on managing the assets of others and are generally fiduciaries to their clients. A fiduciary role means
         that the organization has a responsibility to "do what is in the best interest of the client", not only what is 
         suitable  for the client.  Private equity funds, mutual funds, life insurance companies, unit trusts, hedge funds, 
         and pension funds are the most common types of buy side entities.
Sell-side firms are focused on transactional business...specifically helping buy-side firms transact in assets they wish to
         purchase or sell. Investment Bank(could also be buy side) and securities brokers etc. 
         
Asset management firms can also be classified by type of fund: registered investment companies (which include mutual funds,
        closed end funds, unit investment trusts and ETFs), private funds such as hedge or private equity funds, bank common 
        or collective funds, and separate accounts.
