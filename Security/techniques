1. normal exploit: overwrite the esp with your payload when executing 'ret'
   so EIP would point to your shellcode to execute

2. Data Execution Prevent (DEP) && Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
   DEP prevent data (or code) in certain area especially stack to execute instructions, requiring hardware support
   ASLR randomly lay the memory structure and module to counterfeit ROP
   
3. Return Oriented Programming (ROP): make the eip point to other legitimate module in the process, you can search 
   specific instructions you want, jump there, use several similar gadget to bypass DEP
