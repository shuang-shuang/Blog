1. 2 ways in server authentication: Cookie and Token based
  Cookie based has been used in a long time. 
  a. user send usernam & password to server request auth
  b. server pass auth and Set-Cookie: session = 'cookie'
  c. user send all requests with cookie
  modern token based auth:
  a. user send request: post /authentiaction username = '' && password = ''
  b. server reply a token: http: 200 (token'abdfadafd...')
  c. user send request get /user Authorization: token
  
  Use SSL in both cases to avoid auth info disclosre. See Json Web Token
